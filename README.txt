A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
by Mary Lamb
　
There was a law in the city of Athens which gave to its citizens the power of compelling their daughters to marry whomsoever they pleased ; for upon a daughter's refusing to marry the man her father had chosen to be her husband, the father was empowered by this law to cause her to be put to death ; but as fathers do not often desire the death of their own daughters, even though they do happen to prove a little refractory lo this law was seldom or never put in execution, though perhaps the young ladies of that city were not unfrequently threatened by their parents with the terrors of it.
　
There was one instance. however, of an old man, whose name was Egeus, who actually did come before Theseus (at that time the reigning Duke of Athens), to complain that his daughter Hermia, whom he had commanded to marry Demetrius, a young man of a noble Athenian family, refused to obey him, because she loved another young Athenian, named Lysander Egeus demanded justice of Theseus, and desired that this cruel law might be put in force against his daughter.
